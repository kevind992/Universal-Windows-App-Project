# README

## Introduction
As part of one of my 3rd year modules we had to develope a Universal Windows App. I developed an app called Commute.
Commute is a real time app for bus eirrean services in the Co. Galway area. It provides real time departure information and
bus stop locations using a an interactive map.

## Project Spec Guidelines

- Well designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.
- Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or enhance this user experience.
- Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices, i.e Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services,
sound, network service (connect to server for data), camera, multi touch gestures
- The app must be more than a simple information app.  It must have interactivity as part of the design.

## Running Commute

## Recommendations for Future Development

## Technolegy Used
For developing this application, I did all my coding using Visual Studio 2017.
For my .net service application, I hosted it on Azure and coded on Visual Studio 2017.
